# QuiltingCalc2

by Quteraz

1. The fragments switch correctly in the Backbat activity, but no function is added in the activity.
2. Several xml files that belong to the BackBat activity need some reformatting.
3. When the converter activity is replacing the fragments, the keyboard switches type.
4. Maybe add a function to display the mainActivity's menu with the active activity (other than the startActivity) when in landscape
  orientation and on bigger screens like tablets.
